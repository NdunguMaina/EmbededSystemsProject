Objective:
Design and implement an Intruder Alarm Project utilizing embedded systems and Ultrasonic sensors to enhance security by detecting and alerting against unauthorized access.
Background: 
Protecting personal belongings from intruders poses a challenge as traditional security measures may fall short in providing effective solutions. These traditional security measures, such as locks and keys, are susceptible to various vulnerabilities, and surveillance systems can be costly and complex to install. They also often lack real-time intrusion detection capabilities, leading to delayed responses and increased security risks. 
Therefore, this Intruder Alarm Project addresses this gap by employing Ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in proximity and trigger an alarm, providing an effective solution for safeguarding valuables.
Project Description: 
The Intruder Alarm Project relies on an Arduino Uno board and Ultrasonic sensor. When an object approaches the sensor, the circuit activates a buzzer, emitting a sound. The distance sensitivity of the sensor can be easily adjusted through programming, offering customization based on specific needs.
The Intruder Alarm System offers home security, office protection, and its ability to serves as a cost-effective deterrent against unauthorized access.
Components Required:
•	Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects objects by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back. This data is used to determine the distance of the object from the sensor.
•	LEDs (x2): Visual indicators that provide information about the system's status. For instance, one LED may indicate power, while the other may indicate the activation of the alarm.
•	Resistors (220 ohms) (x2): Are used together with the LED circuits to limit the current flowing through them, protecting the LEDs from damage and ensuring their longevity.
•	Buzzer: Serves as the audible alarm, producing a sound when triggered by the Ultrasonic sensor, alerting users to the presence of an object.
•	Breadboard: Provides a platform for the temporary arrangement and connection of electronic components, facilitating the development and testing phases.
•	Arduino Uno Board: Acts as the brain of the system, receiving data from the Ultrasonic sensor, processing it, and controlling the activation of the LEDs and Buzzer based on predefined criteria.
•	Jumper Wires: They establish electrical connections between various components on the breadboard facilitating seamless integration of the Ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, buzzer, and Arduino Uno board.


Implementation Steps:
Design Phase:
•	Choose appropriate components and these are: Ultrasonic sensor, Arduino Uno, buzzer, breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs, resistors (220 ohms) (x2)
